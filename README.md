# :honeybee: SpellDown

_Spelldown: a spelling match that begins with all the contestants standing and ends when all but one have been forced by the rules to sit down after misspelling a word._

## Inspiration & motivation

This game heavily inspired by the New York Times's Spelling Bee game. The principle is the same, but the rules a slightly different and the puzzles are originally generated from a dictionary (see [Puzzle Generation](#Puzzle-generation) below. The purpose of this project is to address one short-coming of the original: the NYT's version only provides you with one puzzle a day, with no option to revisit past puzzles if you want to keep playing.
